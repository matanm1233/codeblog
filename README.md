## Goal
One of my biggest struggles when learning to code was the feeling of having done hours of research and bugfixing only to not make any tangible progress. It was a frustrating experience which made me not want to return to a project. As a remedy to this problem, I've created a blog where I can post information about my learning, so that even if I'm struggling to learn a new skill, I can still have the satisfaction of logging whatever I learned for my future self to see.

## Technologies
    - Python 3.10 with the Flask framework for a backend server
    - Bootstrap 5.0 for a Front-end library
    - AzureSQL Cloud database to store user info/post data
    - Deployed using Azure Cloud services free tier
    - Flask-SQLAlchemy for database ORM

## Features
    - User authentication and profile customization
    - Logged in users can like and comment on posts
    - Authorized users can make posts of their own to add to the blog
